### About the project
In view of the low availability of solutions related to the adoption of pets, available in the market, which are reliable and easy to interact with the user, we propose a different project, which combines the best of the UI experience with the performance of a mobile tool.

With that in mind, we have prepared a complete platform in order to facilitate the animal adoption process, the necessary resources and documents are available on our registration page. However, we will let you know in advance, we have a strict rating method for Adopters and Protectors, so we have vocational content available so that you are really aware of your furry adoption. ❤️

To adopt a pet, it is not necessary to have a lot, the important thing is to offer love, affection and some care so that it has a full life. In this case, going to an NGO to pick up a pet is already a thing of the past, with technology afoot, we make sure to bridge the gap between you and your new best friend. But, for that, they will probably want to know about your life, profession and if you have all the necessary resources in order to guarantee the pet's quality of life.
#### WHY ADOPT WITH US?
We have an exclusive User Rating system, in order to assess the instance of the pet towards its Adopter, as well as the good treatment in the relationship with its Protector. In addition, we have chat available for Adopters and Protectors of the same pet, facilitating communication during the process.

Not to mention that, by adopting, you help to reduce the number of abandoned dogs and cats, there is no greater motivation! Homeless animals have gone through a lot of suffering and all they need is a home to be truly happy.
